    <h2 id ="sec1">Opponent</h2>
    Kaido the King Of Beasts.<br><br>
    As a massive, muscular Oni, he towers over someone of my stature. His most distinctive feature is his long, wild, busy beard and mustache, along with intricately patterend scales that cover parts of his body, in which reflects his ability to transform into a gigantic, Eastern dragon at will. This is his mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit power.<br><br>
    His reputation is as the "Strongest Creature" is not dramatized as he has immense physical strength and durability. He has been captured and sentenced to death multiple times by the World Government and has still lived through it all. He doesn't even need his Devil Fruit to overpower his enemies at time. He is truly a fearsome opponent.<br><br>
    He has a child, Yamato, who looks up to the former daimyo of Wano who passed away saving his family. Yamato is the key to taking down this fearsome warlord.<br>
